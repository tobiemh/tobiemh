### Hi there, I am Tobie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and software engineer, with expertise in Javascript (Node.js, Ember.js, Electron.js), Golang, Rust, and with experience coding in Ruby, PHP, HTML, Objective-C, Swift, and Python. My area of interest lies within databases, with a focus on distributed databases, and highly-available architectures, having had extensive experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, RethinkDB, Redis, InfluxDB, OrientDB, Firebase, CockroachDB, and TiDB.

I am the founder of [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com) - the ultimate cloud database for tomorrow's applications. SurrealDB is a scalable, distributed, collaborative, document-graph database, for the realtime web. Our source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb). [Give us a star](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) if you like what we are building!
